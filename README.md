    --ghost-num GHOST_NUM       The number of ghosts, it should not be too large to fufill the map.

                                The position of the ghosts, the number it should be equal to your ghostnum.
                                Default is empty, which means random.
    
    --player                    The player agent to use, default is PygameKeyboadAgent
    Choices for that: {RandomAgent,TimidAgent,AlphaBetaAgent,ExpectimaxAgent,MCTSAgent,MaxScoreAgent,QLearningAgent,SarsaAgent,SarsaLambdaAgent,ApproximateQAgent,FullyConnectedDQNAgent,OneHotDQNAgent,ImitationAgent,ActorCriticsAgent,PygameKeyboardAgent,TextualKeyboardAgent}

    Choices for that: {GreedyGhostAgent,GhostAgentSlightlyRandom,SmartGhostsAgent}

    --no-graphic                Whether to use graphic display, default is true. 
                                It could speed the process.

Explanation for the Player Agents:
    PygameKeyboardAgent:        Using the keyboard to control the agent, the default agent.

    RandomAgent:                The player moves to legal position randomly.

    TimidAgent:                 The greedy player always tries to escape from the ghosts.

    AlphaBetaAgent:             The player finds the best action based on the min-max tree.

    ExpectimaxAgent:            The player finds the best action based on the expect of min-max tree.

    MCTSAgent:                  Using the MCTS method to arrange the action for the player.

    MaxScoreAgent:              Using the BFS method to arrange the action for the player.

    Other Agents:               Using different ways of reinforcement learning to train the player.


Explanation for the Enemy Agents:
    GreedyGhostAgentï¼š          The ghosts only consider chasing the player. The default agent.

    hostAgentSlightlyRandom:    The ghosts sometimes act randomly.
